# Tutorâ€™s Point

An online learning platform for the video tutorials on various courses provided by different tutors around the globe. 
Where tutors would create courses and upload videos and students would be able to watch them and learn.

## Getting Started

Check the UML Class diagram present inside _UML Diagrams_ folder to better understand the project flow.

Before trying to run the project create a database for the project by importing __TutorsPoint.sql__ file.

To run the project simply run the __TutorsPoint.jar__ file.
Run the server code present in _src_ folder before uploading any videos.

I used XAMPP server for development purpose to store videos.
